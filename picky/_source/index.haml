      Picky is a really
      %strong easy to use
      and
      %strong
        %a{ :href => 'enterprise.html#use_case_1' } fast
      Ruby search engine that helps your users
      %strong find what they are looking for.
    %h3 Try…
    %p
      %ul
        %li
          A simple
          %a{ :href => 'http://picky-simple-example.heroku.com/' } library example
          (wait 3 seconds for it to boot up).
        %li
          A telephone book search for Switzerland:
          = succeed('.') do
            %a{ :href => 'http://twixtel.com' } TwixTel online
        %li
          A Japanese-German dictionary:
          = succeed('.') do
            %a{ :href => 'http://wadoku.eu/search/index?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=wasabi' } WaDoku
    %h3 What it is
    %p
      A
      %a{ :href => 'details.html' } semantic text search engine
      for categorized data, such as varchar fields from a database (probably like most – if not all – data in your application).
    %p
      The
      %a{ :href => 'features.html#server' } standalone server
      offers a HTTP interface returning crispy clean JSON, and a
      %a{ :href => 'features.html#client' } comfortable web front end
      for your application. There's also a
      %a{ :href => 'features.html#statistics' } statistics web app
      and a
      %a{ :href => 'features.html#live' } live interface
      for changing parameters inside the running server.
    %h3 What it is not
    %p
      A search engine for purely uncategorized data (like text from a book).
      It needs mostly categorized, semantic data (like names, or categories, most database fields, anyway) to excel.
    %h3 Where it is
    %p
      Picky lives in a little cave called
      = succeed('.') do
        %a{ :href => 'http://github.com/floere/picky' } The Github Repo
      He usually pays his rent on time.
  .grid_1
    %p
      = succeed(':') do
        %strong Getting started
      Got 5 minutes?
    %p
      %a{ :href => 'getting_started.html' } Install and run Picky
    %p
      on your computer and adapt the examples.
    %h3 Feedback
    %p
      I'm always glad for your help. So if anything is not working, or not working for you, just shoot me a message:
      %p
        %ul
          %li
            %a{ :href => 'http://github.com/inbox/new/floere' } Message me on github (floere)
          %li
            %a{ :href => 'http://twitter.com/hanke' } Follow me on twitter (hanke)
          %li
            %a{ :href => 'mailto:florian.hanke@gmail.com' } Send me mail (gmail)
      %p
        You might also find excellent Pickyists on IRC in
        %a{ :href => 'http://webchat.freenode.net/' } #picky
        that can also help.

        <h3>Huh? What's a small-text search engine?</h3>
        <p>
          A small-text search engine does not operate on huge blobs of text, but instead on smaller, highly categorized text amounts. For example, on varchar database fields.
        </p>
        <p>
          If your data isn't categorized well (like text from a book), then you should instead choose a full-text search engine, like
          <a href="http://sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx</a>
          or
          <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/solr/">Solr (Lucene)</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Then why use it?</h3>
        <p>
          Picky helps your user find data which in a full-text search engine would be buried in a heap of results. Also, it lets him do so with a Google-y single search field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure the word "peter" is found most often in document #7, but he actually just wants documents by someone with surname "Peter", and not everything related to peters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Picky helps him refine his search by way of a comfortable interface to get exactly what he wants.
        </p>
        <h3>But why not just use a full-text search engine?</h3>
        <p>
          Full-Text search engines do one thing especially well: Making full (i.e. uncategorized heaps of) text searchable.
        </p>
        <p>
          For small, highly categorized text, we simply need new ideas. Picky is one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok, that was my elevator pitch ;)
        </p>
        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>Hoo boy.</p>
        <h3>See me show (it) off</h3>
        <p>
          Using a real
          <a href="http://twixtel.ch">telephone search</a>
          as an example.

          This was at the fantastic
          <a href="http://euruko2010.org/">EuRuKo 2010</a>
          Conference in
          <a href="http://www.google.ch/images?q=krakow+poland">beautiful</a>
          Krakow.

        <h3>Why would one write a search engine in Ruby?</h3>
        <p>
          It's fast enough and the high level really helped understanding it as it evolved. There are some parts that have been written in pedal-to-the-metal C code.
        </p>
        <h3>How does it perform?</h3>
        <p>
          This depends on many factors, but generally we recommend using Picky with a maximum of 120 million data points (we used it there).
          The area under 20 millions is probably best. Your mileage may vary, of course, depending on how many partial indexes you use etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indexing is not too fast, and I'd be glad if it were faster. However, you get the full power of Ruby and fully customizable indexing.

        <h3>Where it is</h3>
        <p>
          Picky lives in a little cave called
          <a href="http://github.com/floere/picky">The Github Repo</a>.
          He usually pays his rent on time.
        </p>
        <h3>Why the octopus?</h3>
        <p>
          Glad you asked. But first, read this
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus">Wikipedia entry about octopuses</a>.
          Also,
          <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=badHUNl2HXU">a movie</a>.
          Finished? I think that sums it up pretty well. And it's cuuute, don't you think? :)
        </p>
        <p>
          But don't call him that. He likes to be called "Octor the Destroyer".
        </p>
        <h3>Why the LGPL license?</h3>
        <p>
          My former employer and I met halfway, so to speak. I'd have preferred a MIT license.
        </p>
